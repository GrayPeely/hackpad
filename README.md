# hackpad
I want to build a macropad for digital art programs; Something with a few keys and maybe a little screen to see the control I'm on. One key to switch between settings for other controls (more usability with less space, so I don’t have to make something big). Keys for saving, new doc, ect. A knob would be useful for zooming in a certain percent.
